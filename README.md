I hate setting up nginx, especially when there's issues with my serverblocks! I've gotten pretty good at it, so I made a script to make my life easier. Two commands and it handles everything else for you.

Took me A LOT OF TIME to get this shid down. Hopefully this makes your life easier.

# Nginx-Scripts
install nginx with a simple prompt! no more annoying copy pasta or manually typing this! Enter your website address and you're DONE. Handles certbot, serverblocks, and more!
